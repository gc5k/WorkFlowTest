* Title: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and hypermetabolism study.
* AIM: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence
of hypermetabolism, relative to body composition,
in patients with ALS and age and sex-matched
healthy controls. In addition, we assessed the association
of hypermetabolism with clinical features of
disease, functional decline and mortality.
